Serve (local): python3 -m http.server 1099 --bind 0.0.0.0

Goal:
- Scanner-like “lighting up” per stimulus (BOLD-like timecourse)
- “Speaking” edges = coupling (not axons)
- Truth tier labels: TEMPLATE vs EMPIRICAL vs SIMULATED

Next steps:
1) Produce TEMPLATE stimulus maps by parcellating NeuroQuery/Neurosynth maps into AAL weights.
2) Produce BASELINE coupling matrix from a small resting-state dataset (starter), then upgrade later.
3) Integrate Switchboard UI into the existing model without breaking the current build.
